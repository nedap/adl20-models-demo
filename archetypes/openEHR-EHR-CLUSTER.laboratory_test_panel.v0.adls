The name attribute of the Laboratory test panel/Result value element is normally replaced in a template or at run-time to carry the name of the specific analyte e.g. 'Haemoglobin', often coded with a refernce terminology such as LOINC, SNOMED CT or NPU.

Where other more complex result patterns are required it may be helpful to specialise this archetype or substitute another.">
