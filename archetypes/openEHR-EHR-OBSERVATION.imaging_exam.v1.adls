			use = <"Use to record all results related to the diagnostic imaging aspects of any imaging examinations performed. 

Use to record the imaging examination components (only) of a more complex procedure, including those that may have been undertaken under imaging guidance.

More complex procedures (such as echocardiaograms or Bone density scans) may be represented using templates or specialised archetypes where additional report content is appropriate.

Will normally be reported back to the requesting clinician as one component within the context of an overall COMPOSITION-based report.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record non-imaging examination findings or activities. For example when imaging is performed as part of a procedure the information related to the procedure must be recorded using the ACTION.procedure archetype or an OBSERVATION for the operative findings. This archetype will only be used to record the findings from the imaging.

Not to be used to record details about any parallel procedure undertaken. Use the specific procedure-related archetypes, for example ACTION.procedure.

Not to be used to record details about medications administered during the imaging test. Use specific medication-related archetypes, for example ACTION.medication.">
