This archetype is designed to record the output from one source, for example one drain or cathether or from vomitus. If there is a multiple sources, such as in a fluid balance chart, then each source will need to be recorded using a separate archetype occurrence within the Fluid Balance Chart template.

A fluid balance chart will typically require a combination of this archetype, OBSERVATION.fluid_output, plus the OBSERVATION.fluid_input and OBSERVATION.fluid_balance archetypes to capture all the required components.">

May also be used to record descriptive assessments of input.
